## üß© Architecture Overview

The project intentionally keeps a clean, beginner‚Äëfriendly structure while leaving room to scale into layered patterns (e.g. Repository, BLoC, Riverpod) if needed.

```
lib/
	main.dart                # App root (MaterialApp + Splash)
	models/                  # Plain data objects (ArticleModel, CategoryModel, ShowCategoryModel)
	services/                # Remote data fetch logic (News, ShowCategoryNews, category data seed)
	views/
		splash_screen.dart     # Animated splash + navigation
		bottom_nav_screen.dart # Root navigation (IndexedStack + BottomNavigationBar)
		home_screen.dart       # Top headlines + trending lists
		explore_screen.dart    # Category grid
		category_news_screen.dart # Articles filtered by category
		search_news.dart       # Keyword search UX
		article_screen.dart    # WebView detail (embedded website)
		widgets/               # Reusable UI components (cards, list items, etc.)
assets/
	images/                  # Category & branding images
	config.json              # Local (git‚Äëignored recommended) API key holder
```

### Data Flow (High Level)

1. UI triggers fetch (e.g. `HomeScreen` calls `News().getNews()`).
2. Service reads `assets/config.json` for `api_key` (prevents hard‚Äëcoding secrets in code).
3. Service performs HTTP request to NewsAPI endpoints.
4. JSON decoded ‚Üí mapped into `ArticleModel` / `ShowCategoryModel`.
5. Widgets render lists (horizontal & vertical) with graceful loading spinners.

### Key Endpoints

-   Top Headlines (source: BBC): `https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=bbc-news`
-   Category Headlines: `https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category={category}`
-   Keyword Search: `https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q={query}`

## üîê API Key Setup

1. Get a free API key from: https://newsapi.org/
2. Create a file at `assets/config.json` (DO NOT COMMIT your real key):
    ```json
    { "api_key": "YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY" }
    ```
3. Ensure the path is declared in `pubspec.yaml` under `assets:` (already done).
4. (Optional) Commit a safe example (`config.json.example`) and add `config.json` to `.gitignore`:
    ```gitignore
    assets/config.json
    ```

---

## üöÄ Getting Started (Run Locally)

Prerequisites:

-   Flutter SDK installed (3.x recommended)
-   Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)

Clone & Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NewsNow.git
cd NewsNow
flutter pub get
cp assets/config.json.example assets/config.json   # then edit with your API key
flutter run
```

Run for specific platforms:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome       # Web
flutter run -d ios          # iOS simulator (macOS only)
flutter run -d android      # Android device/emulator
```

Run tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

Current: Basic widget test scaffold (default).
Suggested Enhancements:

-   Add mock HTTP layer (e.g. `http_mock_adapter` or custom `Client`).
-   Golden tests for cards (`NewsCard`, `NewsHorizontalCard`).
-   Integration test: load home ‚Üí navigate category ‚Üí open article.

---

## üí° Possible Improvements (Roadmap)

-   State management: Riverpod / BLoC for separation & caching.
-   Offline caching (Hive / SQflite) for last-read articles.
-   Theme switching (light/dark system sync).
-   Pagination & infinite scroll for search results.
-   Error & empty states with illustrations.
-   Pull-to-refresh on lists.
-   In-app bookmarking + sharing.
-   Analytics & crash reporting (Firebase).
-   CI pipeline (GitHub Actions: format, analyze, test, build).

## üß≠ Design Choices / Rationale

| Choice                             | Reason                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simplicity over heavy architecture | Keeps learning curve low; easy for recruiters to scan                   |
| Local `config.json` for API key    | Avoids committing secrets; trivial to swap environments                 |
| Separate service classes           | Encapsulates endpoint logic; ready to extend with Repository or caching |
| IndexedStack for tabs              | Preserves state across tab switches                                     |
| WebView for article detail         | Faster MVP vs building custom reader                                    |

## üßë‚Äçüíª For Recruiters

This project demonstrates:

-   Practical Flutter app architecture (clean separation of models/services/views)
-   External API integration & JSON mapping
-   Asynchronous programming & stateful widgets lifecycle
-   UI composition & responsive list rendering patterns
-   Attention to UX polish (animations, loading states, navigation flow)

Focus Areas to Discuss in Interview:

-   How to refactor into layered architecture (Repository + StateNotifier)
-   Offline-first strategy (caching & stale-while-revalidate)
-   Test approach evolution (unit, golden, integration)
-   Performance considerations (image caching, list virtualization)

## üìÇ Project Structure (Expanded)

	pubspec.yaml
	analysis_options.yaml
```

---

## üßπ Code Quality

-   Static analysis via `flutter_lints` (see `analysis_options.yaml`).
-   Null-safe Dart (SDK constraint ^3.8.1).
-   Defensive JSON parsing: filters out articles missing core fields.
